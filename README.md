## Alexa Environment

### Setting up an Alexa Skill
 1. Log on to https://developer.amazon.com/ and create a developer account 
 2. In the Alexa Developer Console, click on "Create Skill"
 3. Select "Custom Skill" and "Start from Scratch"
 4. Click on the "Json Editor" Tab on the left side of the screen and copy paste the skills.json file found in the models   folder of this github
 5. Under Service Endpoint type, select "AWS Lambda ARN" and copy the skill ID onto your clipboard
 6. Under Permissions, allow the skill to use the devices full address
### Setting up AWS Lambda
 1. Log on to https://aws.amazon.com/ and create an account (You might need to input credit card information for billing)
 2. Under Location, make sure it is specified as "US-East (N. Virginia)"
 3. Select Lambda from the available services and click on "Create Function"
 4. Select "Author from Scratch" and name you lambda function
 5. Select pyhton 3.7 as the runtime, and "lambda_basic_execution" as the execution role
 6. Click on the "Create Function" button
 7. Under "Add Triggers", select "Alexa SKills Kit" and copy paste the skill id in you clipboard
 8. Under "Code Entry Type", select "Upload from ZIP"
 9. Upload a zip file of the "Lamdba.py" code found in this github along with the necesary libraries (In this case googlemaps,  ask-sdk-core and ask-sdk-model are all required)
 10. In the Environment Variables Section, Enter the Following:
 ```
API_KEY	             |     "Google API Key"
COUNTRY	             |     "Home Country eg USA"
WORK	             |     "Work Address"
HOME	             |     "Home Address"
```
 11.Click save and copy the ARN number found on the top right of the function
 12. Copy paste the ARN number in the Alexa Developer Console under "Enpoint"

## GUI Environment

Our group used [PyQt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt) and Qt Creator to produce the Graphical User Interface for our alarm clock. By using QtCreator to set the intitial UI design of the application, we were able to quickly initialize any widgets needed. We chose PyQt over Qt5.12(C++) due to the ease of use when delpoying Python3 based code on the Raspberry Pi. In doing so, we avoided any cross compling errors when working between OSX and Raspian Jessie OS. 

Below are the packages and dependencies needed to get your own Smart Alarm up and running.

First, if on OSX, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install required packages:
```
brew install python3
brew install qt5
brew install pyqt5
```
Now, on the machine you are developing on, download [QTCreator](https://www.qt.io/download) to begin creating the UI of the Smart Alarm Clock:
```
Qt Creator Example
```
After editing the .ui file, simply run the following command to convert the .ui file into a python class that initializes the MainWindow object of your GUI as well as any widgets declared from Qt Creator:
```
pyuic5 mainwindow.ui > mainwindow_auto.py
```
As a debug step, I often ran the GUI code on my personal machine to preview any functionalities I implemented. To do so, create a main.py file to run the PyQt application. The following code serves as a good skeleton file when building the functionality of the other widgets in your GUI:
 
``` python
import sys
import PyQt5
from PyQt.QtWidgets import *
import mainwindow_auto

# Main Window of GUI
class MainWindow(QMainWindow, mainwindow_auto.Ui_MainWindow):
    # Call setup for widgits in mainwindow_auto
    def __init__(self):
        super(self.__class__, self).__init__()
        self.setupUi(self)

        # Timer connect every second
        self.time_label.setAlignment(Qt.AlignCenter)
        timer = QTimer(self)
        timer.timeout.connect(self.showTime)
        timer.start()

    # Date Label Connect Function to display digital time
    def showTime(self):
        time = QTime.currentTime()
        time_text = time.toString('hh:mm:ss')
        if (time.second() % 2) == 0:
            time_text = time_text[:2] + ' ' + time_text[3:]
            time_text = time_text[:5] + ' ' + time_text[6:]
        self.time_label.setText(time_text)

# Create Application in main
def main():
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    form = MainWindow()
    form.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

# Script in Python3
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's recap. Your project folder should contain the following files (we can ignore the .cpp and .h extensions). Transport the following files from your development machine to the Raspberry Pi:
```
|__Project_Directory
   |__main.py
   |__mainwindow.ui
   |__mainwindow_auto.py
```
Finally, on your Raspberry Pi, use the apt-get command to download the packages needed to display your new GUI:
```
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
```
Navigate to your project directory and execute the main file to visualize your PyQt GUI!
```
python3 main.py
```
